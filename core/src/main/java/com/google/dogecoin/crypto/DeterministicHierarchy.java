 * Bitcoin's privacy system require new keys to be created for each transaction, but managing all these
 * keys quickly becomes unwieldy. In particular it becomes hard to back up and distribute them. By having
 * a way to derive random-looking but deterministic keys we can make wallet backup simpler and gain the
 * ability to hand out {@link DeterministicKey}s to other people who can then create new addresses
 * on the fly, without having to contact us.</p>
